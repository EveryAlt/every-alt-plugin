Instantly generate accurate alternative text for images on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

EveryAlt instantly generates accurate alternative text for every image – making accessibility, ADA compliance and search engine optimization easy. Powered by our unique mix of artificial-intelligence image and language models.

You upload the image. EveryAlt does the rest.

Our artificial intelligence instantly recognizes objects in photos, reads text from within screenshots, and generates accurate, descriptive, human-readable alternative text.

With our free WordPress plugin, you can generate alt text for all your existing images, all future uploads, or individual images – and you’ll always maintain control to make changes to alternative text generated by EveryAlt.
